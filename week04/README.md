This week we were instructed to pick a few schools in a grouping and I chose to use Universities in the state of Missouri that have NCAA Division I football teams using the list located at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_institutions and by searching for enrollment information from HTML web sources.  I decided a "severe weather day" was related to actual or apparent freezing temperatures, raindfall on freezing days, and snowfall the day of or the day before.  I used the Open Meteo API from within Databricks to gather the historical weather information from January 2026.  These indicators would likely distrupt the attendence, accessibility of the campus via transportation, and the likelyhood the campuses would remain open based on the planned weather or residual weather from the day before.  Only weekdays were considered (unless it snowed the day before, then Sunday would be taken into consideration for snowfall impact) as they are considered "student days."  The ouput includes a day count per the month of January 2026 for type of severe weather day, followed by a column of this amount times the enrollment number to give a better idea on how many students felt the crush of this country-wide storm.  Some limitations to this data include: enrollment was considered consistent, degree of weather impact on each student was considered total, "freezing rain" is a rough estimate of temperature and rainfall, and campus closures or class distruptures were not verified.  A possible imporvement would be to consider hourly data instead of daily data since it is in the recent past.
